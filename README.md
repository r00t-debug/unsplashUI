# unsplash-client

A mini project of mine to get myself familiar with the Nuxt.js Framework. The project is a basic website that fetches images from my profile using the Unsplash API and renders them in a nice format.

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
